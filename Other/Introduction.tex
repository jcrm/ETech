\section{Introduction}\label{sc:Intro}
This application has been designed and developed with augmented reality in mind.
The application is a game in which the user has to first locate an augmented reality marker, where a cube will appear floating above the marker.
On this cube there are five different puzzles, one for each face except the base.
The user then has to rotate the tiles till a path is created from the start tile, tiles with the green backgrounds, to all the end tiles, the tiles with a blue background, has been completed.
Once each face puzzle is done the face disappears and the user has to move onto the next face. Once all faces on a cube has been completed the user has to find another marker, until all six markers have been found.
As well as using the camera of the PS Vita for the augmented reality aspect of the game the application utilise the front touch screen panel for on-screen buttons.
