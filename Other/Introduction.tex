\section{Introduction}\label{sc:Intro}
This application has been designed and developed with augmented reality in mind.
The application is a game in which the user has to first locate an augmented reality marker, where a cube will appear floating above the marker.
On this cube there are five different puzzles, one for each face except the base.
The user then has to rotate the tiles till a path is from the star tile, the green tiles, to all the end tiles, blue tiles, has been completed.
Once each face puzzle is done the face disappears and the user has to move onto the next face. Once all faces on a cube has been completed the user has to find another marker, until all size markers have been found.
As well as using the camera of the PS Vita for the augmented reality aspect of the game the application utilise the front touch screen panel for on screen buttons.
