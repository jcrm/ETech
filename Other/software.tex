The application has been written as mentioned previously with the augmented reality technology in mind.
Due to this the application has been built with object-oriented approach.
This can be seen in how the objects are created.
To start with there is a base game object which has variables and functions that are required by all objects in the application.

This class is then inherited from for the marker object which is designed around being relative to an augmented reality marker.
This object has functions needed to do this such as setting an augmented reality matrix and building the world matrix based upon this new matrix.
This is the type of the objects used to cover the augmented reality markers in the game.
