To complete a puzzle rotate each of the tiles until there is a path from the start tile, as shown in Figure \ref{fig:tiles} as the tile with the green background, to all the end tiles, shown with a blue background.
The centre tile are plain tiles that are used as connectors.
The tiles shown are just one variation of each of the three types of tiles.
Once a puzzle is completed press either the on screen solve button or the SELECT button, this will check to see if there is a path between the start tile and all the end tiles.
If there is then the face will disappear and the next face will be selected. 

Once a cube is completed find another marker and select that cube to be solved.
When every cube has been completed the game is over.
The goal is to complete the game as quickly as possible whilst using the smallest number of solves possible.
While playing the game pressing the on screen pause button or the START button will pause the game.
